# Phonepe_pulse_Data_Analysis
I have created a dashboard to visualize Phonepe pulse Github repository data(https://github.com/ssjsmith750/Phonepe_pulse_Data_Analysis) using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
Transactions Analysis: The Transactions data mainly contains the total Transactions count and total amount in each state and district, 
User Data Analysis: The Users data mainly contains the Registered Users count and App openings via different mobile brands
